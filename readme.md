# Knowledge Buckets

A collection of document collections about differenet domains. Collected knowledge for testing AI systems.

Requirements for my knowledge buckets:

* The content must be **public**. Even if the knowledge bucket itself is not published, by using it with GPT it will become kind-of-public...
* The domain must be **well defined**. The knowledge bucket should be a collection of documents about a specific domain.
* The domain should be broad enough so there are documents.
* The domain should be complex enough so you get a benefit from using it.
