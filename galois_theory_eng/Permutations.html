10. Permutations
</FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>

The "old shell game" is an example of a permutation.  Three shells, 
one containing a pea, are in a row in front of the sucker -- er, I 
mean, client.  The operator then changes the order of the shells 
and challenges the client to tell which one contains the pea.  The 
changing of the order constitutes a <b>permutation</b>.  In the 
shell game there are 6 possible permutations.  The operator may 
do nothing.  This would be the identity permutation where shell 1 
stays in its position, shell 2 stays in its position and shell 3 
also stays in its position.  We can notate this permutation as
<p>
<pre>       | 1 2 3 |
       | 1 2 3 |
</pre>
<p>
The top row of numbers indicates the starting position of a shell.  
The bottom row indicates the final position of the shell.  Thus 
to find where an object went under a permutation look up its 
number in the top row and its final place will be under that number.  
Thus if the shell-game operator switches shells 1 and 2 we can 
notate this permutation by
<p>
<pre>       | 1 2 3 |
       | 2 1 3 |
</pre>
<p>
Shell 1 went to the place formerly occupied by shell 2 (the 2 in 
the bottom row is below the 1) and shell 2 went to the place 
formerly occupied by shell 1 (the 1 in the bottom row is below 
the 2).  Since there are six different orders that the numerals "1, 
2" and "3" can be ordered in the bottom row [the 1 2 3 in the top 
row is fixed] there are 6 permutations of 3 objects.
<p>
The main reasons for interest in permutations are
<UL>
<LI>They form a group when we use the operation "followed by."
<LI>Understanding them helps to solve Rubik's Cube.
<LI>There is a theorem due to Arthur Cayley that says that <b>every 
group is isomorphic to a permutation group</b>.
<LI>Permutations are everywhere whether we know it or not.
</UL>
For a given set the permutations on it form a group with the 
operation 
<i>followed by</i>.  This is because (a) permutations are closed 
under
the operation <i>followed by</i>, (b) since the operation is 
"followed by" 
it is associative, (c) the "leave everything where it is" 
permutation 
is the identity and (c) every permutation can be undone by 
"running the
film backwards" thus all permutations have inverses.
<p>
In a Cayley table for a group each element appears exactly once 
in each
row and exactly once in each column (<i>Latin square property</i>).  
This
is a "pictorial" representation of the cancellation property.  If 
I take
a group element <b>a</b> and multiply it on the right to every 
element
of a group I'll get all the elements of the group back again.  For 
any
element <b>x</b> of <i>G</i> <b>x &#149 a</b> will be in <i>G</i> 
(This
is just the closure property).  
<p>
Furthermore any element of <i>G</i> will be one of the <b>x &#149 
a</b>'s since for any
<b>b</b> in <i>G</i> the equation <b>x &#149 a = b</b> has a 
solution.
Thus multiplication on the right by <b>a</b> permutes the elements 
of 
<i>G</i>.  What if we were to first permute the elements of <i>G</i> 
by
multiplying on the right by <b>a</b> <i>followed by</i> multiplying 
on
the right by <b>b</b>?  That would give us a new permutation which 
would
(by the associative property) be the same as multiplying on the 
right
by <b>a &#149 b</b>.  
<p>
Thus each element of <i>G</i> corresponds to a unique permutation 
of the elements of <i>g</i>.  And the
permutation corresponding to the product of two elements of <i>G</i> 
is
the composition under <i>followed by</i> of the permutations 
corresponding
to the two elements singly.  This fits the definition of an 
isomorphism.
Thus every group is isomorphic to a permutation group.  This result
is known as <b>Cayley's Theorem</b>.
<p>
<b>Rubik's Cube</b> and similar puzzles are examples of 
<b>permutation puzzles</b>.
 The challenge is to form a certain permutation from the 
composition of
a limited set of permutations.  The permutation you are challenged 
to
find is the one that permutes everything into the <i>solved</i> 
state.  Exactly which permutation that is depends on the initial
state. We will have much more to say concerning Rubik's Cube
in a later chapter.

An old bar bet involves three glasses on the bar.  They are in a row
in front of the sucker -- er, I mean client, but the first and third
glasses are mouth-down on the bar.  Let "D" stand for a mouth-down glass
and "U" stand for a mouth-up glass.  Then the client sees the following
row of glasses:
<b><pre>
            D U D
</b></pre>
"The object of the game," you tell him, "is to get all the glasses
mouth-up in exactly three moves.  A move consists of turning two
glasses over together, one in each hand."  Then you demonstrate by
turning over the first two glasses to reach
<b><pre>
            U D D
</b></pre>
Then you turn over the 1st and 3rd glasses
<b><pre>
            D D U
</b></pre>
Finally you turn over the first two glasses again
<b><pre>
            U U U
</b></pre>
All very clean and simple.  You now turn over the middle
glass and bet your "friend" that he can't do what he just saw
you do.  He, having had a few drinks, pulls out his wallet and
bets you.  He begins facing
<b><pre>
            U D U
</b></pre>
and no matter what he tries he can't get them all mouth-up in
exactly three moves.
<p>
The secret of the trick is <b>parity</b>.  The number of mouth-up
glasses is either even or odd.  Turning over one glass will change
the number of mouth-up glasses from odd to even or else from even 
to odd since you will be either adding a mouth-up glass or 
subtracting a mouth-up glass.  In the game you must turn over 
<i>two</i> glasses simultaneously and therefore the parity, either 
<b>odd</b> or <b>even</b> of the number of mouth-up glasses does 
not change.  Now the desired final position has 3 (an odd number) 
of mouth up glasses.  The trick is that <b>you</b> start with 1 
(an odd number) of mouth-up glasses but you have your "friend" 
begin with 2 (an even number) of mouth up glasses.  He can't win.
<p>
Permutations also have a parity which is changed by a 
<b>transposition</b>.  A transposition is a permutation which
exchanges the place of two objects whilst leaving all the other
objects unmoved.  Thus
<pre>
          | 1 2 3 4 5 |
          | 1 5 3 4 2 |
</pre>
is a transposition as it swaps elements 2 and 5 and does not change
the positions of 1, 3 and 4.  An important fact is that any 
permutation on n objects can be done with a series of transpositions.
It is a further fact that if it can be done in an even number of
permutations then it can't be done in an odd number and vice versa.
<p>
<b>Theorem</b>: Every permutation is equivalent to a product of
transpositions.
<p>
<b>Proof:</b> A simple way to see this is to think of how you might
reorder a dozen eggs in an egg carton.  Suppose the eggs were 
numbered 1 to 12.  If you were given a permutation of the eggs and 
told to rearrange the eggs into that permutation you might begin 
with the first place in the egg carton, find the numbered egg that 
went into that place and traded the egg in the first place with the 
egg that belonged there.  Repeat this process with the second place 
then the third place etc.  After a minimum of 11 transpositions you 
would be done. (Why a minimum of ll and not 12?)
<p>
The same could be done with any permutation on n objects.  First
note the object that 1 goes to.  If necessary exchange it for 
object 1.  Next note the object that 2 goes to.  If necessary 
exchange it for object 2 etc.  After, at most, n-1 such 
transpositions you will have the desired permutation.
<p>
[<b>Exercise</b>:  Use the above procedure to express the permutation
<pre>
            | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 |
            | 4 5 6 3 8 7 1 2 |
</pre>
as the product of transpositions.]
<p>
The second fact is that if a permutation can result from an 
<b>odd</b> number of transpositions then it can't result from an 
<b>even</b> number of permutations and vice versa.  To see this we
will define the parity of a permutation:  For each element count up
the number of elements that were before it in the order before the
permutation which are after it after the permutation has been applied.
For instance in the permutation
<pre>
            | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 |
            | 1 4 6 3 5 2 7 |
</pre>
there are no elements before 1 before the permutation so the total
for 1 is zero.  There are two elements after 4 that were before 4
to begin with, namely 2 and 3 so the total for 4 is 2.  Continuing
in this manner we find that the total for 6 is 3, the total for 3
is 1, the total for 5 is 1, the total for 2 is zero, and the total 
for 7 is zero.  Adding up these totals we get a <b>grand total</b>:  
<p>
<center><b> 0 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 7 </b></center>
<p>
If the grand total is an odd number then the permutation is of <b>odd 
parity</b>.  If the grand total is an even number then the permutation
is of <b>even parity</b>.
<p>
7 is an odd number so the example is an odd permutation.  If you apply
any transposition to this permutation you will end up with an even
permutation. (Try it!).
<p>
Why is this so?  Why does each transposition change the parity of
a permutation?  Let's look at what a transposition does to the parity.
Let the following represent an ordering of the n numbers 1 to n.
<p><center>
<b> a</b><sub>1</sub><b> a</b><sub>2</sub><b> . . . x . . . y . . . 
a</b><sub>n-1</sub> <b>a</b><sub>1</sub></center>   
<p>
Each number in the string of numbers  can affect the grand total in 
two ways.  First when it is the number we're using to count how many
smaller numbers are beyond it and second when it is one of the 
numbers "beyond" whatever number we're using to count how many smaller
numbers are beyond.
<p>
Now if we exchange elements labeled <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> how will
the parity of the grand total change?  Let's break up the numbers
into three groups.
<OL>
<LI>The numbers either before both <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> or after 
    both <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>
<LI>The numbers between <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.
<LI><b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.
</OL>
The same numbers will be before and after the numbers in group 1 so 
their contribution to the grand total will not change.  The numbers 
in group 2 will each contribute to the grand total twice once for 
the change in <b>x</b>'s position (either they were less than x 
or x was less than them.) and again for the change in <b>y</b>'s 
position.  Thus their total contribution will be to change the 
grand total by an even number.  This will not affect the parity of 
the permutation.  Finally, <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>
switching places will add or subtract 1 from the grand total depending
on whether <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> is greater.  Thus the parity of the
grand total (odd or even) will change.
<p>
Now we are in a position to appreciate Samuel Loyd's famous challenge
with his 14-15 puzzle back in the 1800's.  The puzzle consisted
of 15 sliding tiles in a square frame with an empty space which a tile could slide into.  The tiles were numbered from 1 to 15.  The task was to get the tiles into the normal order:
<p>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>7</TD><TD>8</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>9</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>11</TD><TD>12</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>13</TD><TD>14</TD><TD>15</TD><TD> . </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
Sliding a tile into the empty space is equivalent to a transposition
of the moved tile and the "ghost" tile in the empty space.  Thus every
move is a transposition. (read the numbers from right to left, top row
to bottom to get the permutation). 
<p>
Sam Loyd offered $1000 to any one who could find a way to solve the
puzzle from the position shown below.
<p>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>7</TD><TD>8</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>9</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>11</TD><TD>12</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>13</TD><TD>15</TD><TD>14</TD><TD> . </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
Note that this is a transposition away from the solution.  However
it is impossible to solve from this position since it would take
an odd number of transpositions to go from the 13-15-14 position 
to the solved 13-14-15 position. But the empty square can only
return to the lower right-hand corner after an even number of moves.
The simplest way to see this is to imagine a checkerboard pattern
of light and dark squares painted beneath the tiles.  Then each move
would change the color of the background square that is showing from 
light to dark or from dark to light.  Loyd 
sold a pavillion of the puzzles to suckers -- er, I mean puzzle fans
eager to win the prize.  He reported that
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   A prize of $1,000 offered for the first correct solution to
   the problem, has never been claimed, although there are 
   thousands of persons who say they performed the required feat.
   <p>
   People became infatuated with the puzzle and ludicrous tales
   are told of shopkeepers who neglected to open their stores;
   of a distinguished clergyman who stood under a street lamp all
   through a wintry night trying to recall the way he had performed
   the feat.  The mysterious feature of the puzzle is that none
   seem to be able to remember the sequence of moves whereby they
   feel sure they succeeded in solving the puzzle.  Pilots are said
   to have wrecked their ships, and engineers rush their trains past
   stations.  A famous Baltimore editor tells how he went for his
   noon lunch and was discovered by his frantic staff long past
   midnight pushing little pieces of pie around on a plate!
</bLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
A particularly insidious version of the puzzle has letters on the 
tiles instead of numbers.  One of its "solved" configurations is
<p>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>R</TD><TD>A</TD><TD>T</TD><TD>E</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Y</TD><TD>O</TD><TD>U</TD><TD>R</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>M</TD><TD>I</TD><TD>N</TD><TD>D</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>P</TD><TD>A</TD><TD>L</TD><TD> . </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
Notice that there are two 'R's and two 'A's.  If the "wrong"  
'R' and 'A' are used to begin the word "RATE" it will be 
impossible to get the "PAL" to come out correctly in the last 
row.  With this version the group theorist "bets" the sucker -- 
er, I mean friend, that although the friend is accomplished at 
solving the 13-14-15 puzzle the use of letters rather than 
numbers will throw him off psychologically.  The group theorist 
mixes up the tiles in front of the friend's eyes but leaves the 
'R' in the upper left-hand corner in place while taking the 
'A' next to it far down to the lower row.  At the same time the 
'A' in "PAL" is transferred near the upper left-hand corner.  The
friend is given a time limit to solve the puzzle.  If he uses the
'R' and 'A' together that the group theorist has so kindly put
almost into place for him he cuts his own throat.  To 
solve the puzzle with the 'R' and 'A' as given is equivalent to 
making a transposition of the 'A's.  As we now know, this is not 
possible.
